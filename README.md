# Forevle

A progressive word guessing game

## Availability

The game is publicly available at `https://hurgle.com/games/forevle`. It was briefly available at the domain `http://forevle.com` as well. NOTE: This repo is currently public and I can't change the visibility of that at the moment (until I add more seats to the org, apparently).

## TODO
- hey you! forevle is a hit with my fiance's family. they ran into a few bugs that i wanted to share. one user had the new grids stop populating after a bit. the keyboard doesn't fit on some screens and you need to scroll over to use it. the grids sometimes go from 3 additional down to 2 additional then back up to 3
